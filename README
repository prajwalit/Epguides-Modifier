Epiguides modifier.

I use Epiguides a lot. but I don't like most of the stuff on the site. so I created this extension to modify Epiguides according to my liking.

All the crap info and links get deleted. 
Seasons in reversed order. 
Adds my naming convension for episodes.

If there are any issues with this extension, contact me - i.fix.sites [at] gmail [dot] com
or ping me on twitter - http://twitter.com/prajwalit
